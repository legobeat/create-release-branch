[1mDESCRIPTION[0m
       [1mgrep  [22msearches for [4mPATTERNS[24m in each [4mFILE[24m.  [4mPATTERNS[24m is one or more patterns separated by
       newline characters, and [1mgrep  [22mprints  each  line  that  matches  a  pattern.   Typically
       [4mPATTERNS[24m should be quoted when [1mgrep [22mis used in a shell command.

       A  [4mFILE[24m  of  “[1m-[22m”  stands  for  standard  input.  If no [4mFILE[24m is given, recursive searches
       examine the working directory, and nonrecursive searches read standard input.

       In addition, the variant programs [1megrep [22mand [1mfgrep [22mare the same as [1mgrep -E  [22mand  [1mgrep -F[22m,
       respectively.    These   variants   are   deprecated,  but  are  provided  for  backward
       compatibility.

   [1mGeneric Program Information[0m
       [1m--help [22mOutput a usage message and exit.

       [1m-V[22m, [1m--version[0m
              Output the version number of [1mgrep [22mand exit.

   [1mPattern Syntax[0m
       [1m-E[22m, [1m--extended-regexp[0m
              Interpret [4mPATTERNS[24m as extended regular expressions (EREs, see below).

       [1m-F[22m, [1m--fixed-strings[0m
              Interpret [4mPATTERNS[24m as fixed strings, not regular expressions.

       [1m-G[22m, [1m--basic-regexp[0m
              Interpret [4mPATTERNS[24m as basic regular expressions (BREs, see below).  This  is  the
              default.

       [1m-P[22m, [1m--perl-regexp[0m
              Interpret  I<PATTERNS>  as  Perl-compatible  regular  expressions  (PCREs).  This
              option is experimental when combined with the [1m-z [22m([1m--null-data[22m) option,  and  [1mgrep[0m
              [1m-P [22mmay warn of unimplemented features.

   [1mMatching Control[0m
       [1m-e [4m[22mPATTERNS[24m, [1m--regexp=[4m[22mPATTERNS[0m
              Use  [4mPATTERNS[24m  as  the  patterns.   If  this  option is used multiple times or is
              combined with the [1m-f [22m([1m--file[22m) option, search for all patterns given.  This option
              can be used to protect a pattern beginning with “-”.

       [1m-f [4m[22mFILE[24m, [1m--file=[4m[22mFILE[0m
              Obtain  patterns  from [4mFILE[24m, one per line.  If this option is used multiple times
              or is combined with the [1m-e [22m([1m--regexp[22m) option, search for all patterns given.  The
              empty file contains zero patterns, and therefore matches nothing.

       [1m-i[22m, [1m--ignore-case[0m
              Ignore  case  distinctions  in  patterns  and input data, so that characters that
              differ only in case match each other.

       [1m--no-ignore-case[0m
              Do not ignore case distinctions in patterns and input data.  This is the default.
              This option is useful for passing to shell scripts that already use [1m-i[22m, to cancel
              its effects because the two options override each other.

       [1m-v[22m, [1m--invert-match[0m
              Invert the sense of matching, to select non-matching lines.

       [1m-w[22m, [1m--word-regexp[0m
              Select only those lines containing matches that form whole words.   The  test  is
              that  the  matching  substring  must  either  be at the beginning of the line, or
              preceded by a non-word constituent character.  Similarly, it must  be  either  at
              the  end  of  the  line  or  followed by a non-word constituent character.  Word-
              constituent characters are letters, digits, and the underscore.  This option  has
              no effect if [1m-x [22mis also specified.

       [1m-x[22m, [1m--line-regexp[0m
              Select  only  those  matches  that  exactly  match the whole line.  For a regular
              expression pattern, this is like parenthesizing the pattern and then  surrounding
              it with [1m^ [22mand [1m$[22m.

       [1m-y     [22mObsolete synonym for [1m-i[22m.

   [1mGeneral Output Control[0m
       [1m-c[22m, [1m--count[0m
              Suppress  normal  output;  instead print a count of matching lines for each input
              file.  With the [1m-v[22m, [1m--invert-match [22moption (see below), count non-matching lines.

       [1m--color[22m[[1m=[4m[22mWHEN[24m], [1m--colour[22m[[1m=[4m[22mWHEN[24m]
              Surround the matched (non-empty) strings, matching  lines,  context  lines,  file
              names,  line  numbers,  byte  offsets,  and  separators (for fields and groups of
              context lines) with escape sequences to display them in color  on  the  terminal.
              The  colors  are defined by the environment variable [1mGREP_COLORS[22m.  The deprecated
              environment variable [1mGREP_COLOR [22mis still supported, but its setting does not have
              priority.  [4mWHEN[24m is [1mnever[22m, [1malways[22m, or [1mauto[22m.

       [1m-L[22m, [1m--files-without-match[0m
              Suppress  normal  output; instead print the name of each input file from which no
              output would normally have been printed.

       [1m-l[22m, [1m--files-with-matches[0m
              Suppress normal output; instead print the name of  each  input  file  from  which
              output  would  normally  have  been printed.  Scanning each input file stops upon
              first match.

       [1m-m [4m[22mNUM[24m, [1m--max-count=[4m[22mNUM[0m
              Stop reading a file after [4mNUM[24m matching lines.  If the  input  is  standard  input
              from  a  regular  file,  and [4mNUM[24m matching lines are output, [1mgrep [22mensures that the
              standard input is positioned to just after the last matching line before exiting,
              regardless  of  the  presence  of trailing context lines.  This enables a calling
              process to resume a search.  When [1mgrep [22mstops after [4mNUM[24m matching lines, it outputs
              any  trailing  context  lines.   When the [1m-c [22mor [1m--count [22moption is also used, [1mgrep[0m
              does not output a count greater than [4mNUM[24m.  When the [1m-v [22mor  [1m--invert-match  [22moption
              is also used, [1mgrep [22mstops after outputting [4mNUM[24m non-matching lines.

       [1m-o[22m, [1m--only-matching[0m
              Print  only the matched (non-empty) parts of a matching line, with each such part
              on a separate output line.

       [1m-q[22m, [1m--quiet[22m, [1m--silent[0m
              Quiet; do not write anything to standard  output.   Exit  immediately  with  zero
              status  if any match is found, even if an error was detected.  Also see the [1m-s [22mor
              [1m--no-messages [22moption.

       [1m-s[22m, [1m--no-messages[0m
              Suppress error messages about nonexistent or unreadable files.

   [1mOutput Line Prefix Control[0m
       [1m-b[22m, [1m--byte-offset[0m
              Print the 0-based byte offset within the input file before each line  of  output.
              If  [1m-o  [22m([1m--only-matching[22m)  is  specified,  print  the offset of the matching part
              itself.

       [1m-H[22m, [1m--with-filename[0m
              Print the file name for each match.  This is the default when there is more  than
              one file to search.  This is a GNU extension.

       [1m-h[22m, [1m--no-filename[0m
              Suppress  the  prefixing of file names on output.  This is the default when there
              is only one file (or only standard input) to search.

       [1m--label=[4m[22mLABEL[0m
              Display input actually coming from standard  input  as  input  coming  from  file
              [4mLABEL[24m.   This  can be useful for commands that transform a file's contents before
              searching, e.g., [1mgzip -cd foo.gz | grep --label=foo -H 'some pattern'[22m.  See  also
              the [1m-H [22moption.

       [1m-n[22m, [1m--line-number[0m
              Prefix each line of output with the 1-based line number within its input file.

       [1m-T[22m, [1m--initial-tab[0m
              Make  sure that the first character of actual line content lies on a tab stop, so
              that the alignment of tabs looks normal.  This is useful with options that prefix
              their  output  to  the  actual  content:  [1m-H[22m,[1m-n[22m, and [1m-b[22m.  In order to improve the
              probability that lines from a single file will all start at the same column, this
              also  causes  the  line  number  and  byte offset (if present) to be printed in a
              minimum size field width.

       [1m-Z[22m, [1m--null[0m
              Output a zero byte (the ASCII  [1mNUL  [22mcharacter)  instead  of  the  character  that
              normally  follows  a  file name.  For example, [1mgrep -lZ [22moutputs a zero byte after
              each file name instead of the  usual  newline.   This  option  makes  the  output
              unambiguous,  even  in  the  presence of file names containing unusual characters
              like newlines.  This option can be used with commands like [1mfind -print0[22m, [1mperl -0[22m,
              [1msort  -z[22m,  and  [1mxargs -0 [22mto process arbitrary file names, even those that contain
              newline characters.

   [1mContext Line Control[0m
       [1m-A [4m[22mNUM[24m, [1m--after-context=[4m[22mNUM[0m
              Print [4mNUM[24m lines  of  trailing  context  after  matching  lines.   Places  a  line
              containing a group separator ([1m--[22m) between contiguous groups of matches.  With the
              [1m-o [22mor [1m--only-matching [22moption, this has no effect and a warning is given.

       [1m-B [4m[22mNUM[24m, [1m--before-context=[4m[22mNUM[0m
              Print [4mNUM[24m lines  of  leading  context  before  matching  lines.   Places  a  line
              containing a group separator ([1m--[22m) between contiguous groups of matches.  With the
              [1m-o [22mor [1m--only-matching [22moption, this has no effect and a warning is given.

       [1m-C [4m[22mNUM[24m, [1m-[4m[22mNUM[24m, [1m--context=[4m[22mNUM[0m
              Print [4mNUM[24m lines of output context.  Places a line containing  a  group  separator
              ([1m--[22m)  between  contiguous  groups  of  matches.   With  the [1m-o [22mor [1m--only-matching[0m
              option, this has no effect and a warning is given.

       [1m--group-separator=[4m[22mSEP[0m
              When [1m-A[22m, [1m-B[22m, or [1m-C [22mare in use, print [4mSEP[24m instead of [1m-- [22mbetween groups of lines.

       [1m--no-group-separator[0m
              When [1m-A[22m, [1m-B[22m, or [1m-C [22mare in use, do not print a separator between groups of lines.

   [1mFile and Directory Selection[0m
       [1m-a[22m, [1m--text[0m
              Process  a  binary  file  as  if  it  were  text;  this  is  equivalent  to   the
              [1m--binary-files=text [22moption.

       [1m--binary-files=[4m[22mTYPE[0m
              If  a file's data or metadata indicate that the file contains binary data, assume
              that the file is of type [4mTYPE[24m.  Non-text bytes indicate binary  data;  these  are
              either  output  bytes that are improperly encoded for the current locale, or null
              input bytes when the [1m-z [22moption is not given.

              By default, [4mTYPE[24m is [1mbinary[22m, and [1mgrep [22msuppresses output after  null  input  binary
              data  is  discovered, and suppresses output lines that contain improperly encoded
              data.  When some output is suppressed, [1mgrep [22mfollows any output  with  a  one-line
              message saying that a binary file matches.

              If  [4mTYPE[24m  is [1mwithout-match[22m, when [1mgrep [22mdiscovers null input binary data it assumes
              that the rest of the file does not match; this is equivalent to the [1m-I [22moption.

              If [4mTYPE[24m is [1mtext[22m, [1mgrep [22mprocesses a binary  file  as  if  it  were  text;  this  is
              equivalent to the [1m-a [22moption.

              When  [4mtype[24m  is  [1mbinary[22m,  [1mgrep  [22mmay  treat non-text bytes as line terminators even
              without the [1m-z [22moption.  This means choosing [1mbinary [22mversus [1mtext [22mcan affect whether
              a  pattern matches a file.  For example, when [4mtype[24m is [1mbinary [22mthe pattern [1mq$ might[0m
              match [1mq [22mimmediately followed by a null byte, even though this is not matched when
              [4mtype[24m  is  [1mtext[22m.  Conversely, when [4mtype[24m is [1mbinary [22mthe pattern [1m. [22m(period) might not
              match a null byte.

              [4mWarning:[24m The [1m-a [22moption might output binary garbage, which  can  have  nasty  side
              effects if the output is a terminal and if the terminal driver interprets some of
              it as commands.  On the other hand, when reading files whose text  encodings  are
              unknown,  it can be helpful to use [1m-a [22mor to set [1mLC_ALL='C' [22min the environment, in
              order to find more matches even if the matches are unsafe for direct display.

       [1m-D [4m[22mACTION[24m, [1m--devices=[4m[22mACTION[0m
              If an input file is a device, FIFO or socket,  use  [4mACTION[24m  to  process  it.   By
              default,  [4mACTION[24m  is [1mread[22m, which means that devices are read just as if they were
              ordinary files.  If [4mACTION[24m is [1mskip[22m, devices are silently skipped.

       [1m-d [4m[22mACTION[24m, [1m--directories=[4m[22mACTION[0m
              If an input file is a directory, use [4mACTION[24m to process it.  By default, [4mACTION[24m is
              [1mread[22m,  i.e.,  read directories just as if they were ordinary files.  If [4mACTION[24m is
              [1mskip[22m, silently skip directories.  If [4mACTION[24m is [1mrecurse[22m, read all files under each
              directory,  recursively, following symbolic links only if they are on the command
              line.  This is equivalent to the [1m-r [22moption.

       [1m--exclude=[4m[22mGLOB[0m
              Skip any command-line file with a name suffix  that  matches  the  pattern  [4mGLOB[24m,
              using  wildcard  matching;  a name suffix is either the whole name, or a trailing
              part that starts with a non-slash character immediately after a slash ([1m/[22m) in  the
              name.  When searching recursively, skip any subfile whose base name matches [4mGLOB[24m;
              the base name is the part after the last slash.  A pattern  can  use  [1m*[22m,  [1m?[22m,  and
              [1m[[22m...[1m] [22mas wildcards, and [1m\ [22mto quote a wildcard or backslash character literally.

       [1m--exclude-from=[4m[22mFILE[0m
              Skip  files  whose  base  name  matches any of the file-name globs read from [4mFILE[0m
              (using wildcard matching as described under [1m--exclude[22m).

       [1m--exclude-dir=[4m[22mGLOB[0m
              Skip any command-line directory with a name suffix that matches the pattern [4mGLOB[24m.
              When  searching  recursively, skip any subdirectory whose base name matches [4mGLOB[24m.
              Ignore any redundant trailing slashes in [4mGLOB[24m.

       [1m-I     [22mProcess a binary file as if it did not contain matching data; this is  equivalent
              to the [1m--binary-files=without-match [22moption.

       [1m--include=[4m[22mGLOB[0m
              Search  only  files  whose  base  name  matches  [4mGLOB[24m (using wildcard matching as
              described under [1m--exclude[22m).  If contradictory [1m--include [22mand [1m--exclude [22moptions are
              given, the last matching one wins.  If no [1m--include [22mor [1m--exclude [22moptions match, a
              file is included unless the first such option is [1m--include[22m.

       [1m-r[22m, [1m--recursive[0m
              Read all files under each directory, recursively, following symbolic  links  only
              if  they are on the command line.  Note that if no file operand is given, B<grep>
              searches the working directory.  This is equivalent to the [1m-d recurse [22moption.

       [1m-R[22m, [1m--dereference-recursive[0m
              Read all files under each directory, recursively.   Follow  all  symbolic  links,
              unlike [1m-r[22m.

   [1mOther Options[0m
       [1m--line-buffered[0m
              Use line buffering on output.  This can cause a performance penalty.

       [1m-U[22m, [1m--binary[0m
              Treat  the  file(s)  as  binary.   By  default, under MS-DOS and MS-Windows, [1mgrep[0m
              guesses whether a file is text or binary  as  described  for  the  [1m--binary-files[0m
              option.   If  [1mgrep  [22mdecides  the file is a text file, it strips the CR characters
              from the original file contents (to make regular expressions with [1m^  [22mand  [1m$  [22mwork
              correctly).  Specifying [1m-U [22moverrules this guesswork, causing all files to be read
              and passed to the matching mechanism verbatim; if the file is a  text  file  with
              CR/LF  pairs at the end of each line, this will cause some regular expressions to
              fail.  This option has no effect on platforms other than MS-DOS and MS-Windows.

       [1m-z[22m, [1m--null-data[0m
              Treat input and output data as sequences of lines, each terminated by a zero byte
              (the  ASCII  NUL  character) instead of a newline.  Like the [1m-Z [22mor [1m--null [22moption,
              this option can be used with commands like [1msort  -z  [22mto  process  arbitrary  file
              names.

[1mREGULAR EXPRESSIONS[0m
       A  regular expression is a pattern that describes a set of strings.  Regular expressions
       are constructed analogously to arithmetic expressions, by  using  various  operators  to
       combine smaller expressions.

       [1mgrep  [22munderstands  three different versions of regular expression syntax: “basic” (BRE),
       “extended” (ERE) and “perl” (PCRE).  In GNU [1mgrep [22mthere is  no  difference  in  available
       functionality  between  basic  and  extended  syntaxes.  In other implementations, basic
       regular expressions are less powerful.  The following description  applies  to  extended
       regular   expressions;   differences   for  basic  regular  expressions  are  summarized
       afterwards.  Perl-compatible regular expressions give additional functionality, and  are
       documented  in  B<pcresyntax>(3) and B<pcrepattern>(3), but work only if PCRE support is
       enabled.

       The fundamental building  blocks  are  the  regular  expressions  that  match  a  single
       character.   Most  characters, including all letters and digits, are regular expressions
       that match themselves.  Any  meta-character  with  special  meaning  may  be  quoted  by
       preceding it with a backslash.

       The  period  [1m.  [22mmatches  any  single character.  It is unspecified whether it matches an
       encoding error.

   [1mCharacter Classes and Bracket Expressions[0m
       A [4mbracket[24m [4mexpression[24m is a list of characters enclosed by [1m[ [22mand [1m][22m.  It matches any single
       character  in  that  list.   If  the  first character of the list is the caret [1m^ [22mthen it
       matches any character [4mnot[24m in the list; it is unspecified whether it matches an  encoding
       error.  For example, the regular expression [1m[0123456789] [22mmatches any single digit.

       Within  a bracket expression, a [4mrange[24m [4mexpression[24m consists of two characters separated by
       a hyphen.  It matches any single  character  that  sorts  between  the  two  characters,
       inclusive, using the locale's collating sequence and character set.  For example, in the
       default C locale, [1m[a-d] [22mis equivalent  to  [1m[abcd][22m.   Many  locales  sort  characters  in
       dictionary  order,  and in these locales [1m[a-d] [22mis typically not equivalent to [1m[abcd][22m; it
       might be equivalent to [1m[aBbCcDd][22m, for example.  To obtain the traditional interpretation
       of  bracket  expressions,  you  can  use  the C locale by setting the [1mLC_ALL [22menvironment
       variable to the value [1mC[22m.

       Finally, certain named classes of characters are predefined within bracket  expressions,
       as  follows.   Their  names  are  self  explanatory,  and they are [1m[:alnum:][22m, [1m[:alpha:][22m,
       [1m[:blank:][22m, [1m[:cntrl:][22m, [1m[:digit:][22m, [1m[:graph:][22m, [1m[:lower:][22m, [1m[:print:][22m, [1m[:punct:][22m,  [1m[:space:][22m,
       [1m[:upper:][22m,  and  [1m[:xdigit:][22m.   For  example,  [1m[[:alnum:]]  [22mmeans  the character class of
       numbers and letters in the current locale.  In the C  locale  and  ASCII  character  set
       encoding, this is the same as [1m[0-9A-Za-z][22m.  (Note that the brackets in these class names
       are part of the symbolic names, and  must  be  included  in  addition  to  the  brackets
       delimiting  the  bracket  expression.)   Most meta-characters lose their special meaning
       inside bracket expressions.  To include  a  literal  [1m]  [22mplace  it  first  in  the  list.
       Similarly,  to  include  a literal [1m^ [22mplace it anywhere but first.  Finally, to include a
       literal [1m- [22mplace it last.

   [1mAnchoring[0m
       The caret [1m^ [22mand the dollar sign [1m$ [22mare meta-characters that respectively match the  empty
       string at the beginning and end of a line.

   [1mThe Backslash Character and Special Expressions[0m
       The  symbols [1m\< [22mand [1m\> [22mrespectively match the empty string at the beginning and end of a
       word.  The symbol [1m\b [22mmatches the empty string at the edge of a word, and [1m\B [22mmatches  the
       empty  string  provided  it's [4mnot[24m at the edge of a word.  The symbol [1m\w [22mis a synonym for
       [1m[_[:alnum:]] [22mand [1m\W [22mis a synonym for [1m[^_[:alnum:]][22m.

   [1mRepetition[0m
       A regular expression may be followed by one of several repetition operators:
       [1m?      [22mThe preceding item is optional and matched at most once.
       [1m*      [22mThe preceding item will be matched zero or more times.
       [1m+      [22mThe preceding item will be matched one or more times.
       [1m{[4m[22mn[24m[1m}    [22mThe preceding item is matched exactly [4mn[24m times.
       [1m{[4m[22mn[24m[1m,}   [22mThe preceding item is matched [4mn[24m or more times.
       [1m{,[4m[22mm[24m[1m}   [22mThe preceding item is matched at most [4mm[24m times.  This is a GNU extension.
       [1m{[4m[22mn[24m[1m,[4m[22mm[24m[1m}  [22mThe preceding item is matched at least [4mn[24m times, but not more than [4mm[24m times.

   [1mConcatenation[0m
       Two regular expressions may be concatenated; the resulting  regular  expression  matches
       any   string  formed  by  concatenating  two  substrings  that  respectively  match  the
       concatenated expressions.

   [1mAlternation[0m
       Two regular expressions may be joined by the infix operator  [1m|[22m;  the  resulting  regular
       expression matches any string matching either alternate expression.

   [1mPrecedence[0m
       Repetition  takes  precedence  over  concatenation,  which in turn takes precedence over
       alternation.  A whole expression may  be  enclosed  in  parentheses  to  override  these
       precedence rules and form a subexpression.

   [1mBack-references and Subexpressions[0m
       The  back-reference  [1m\[4m[22mn[24m,  where  [4mn[24m  is  a single digit, matches the substring previously
       matched by the [4mn[24mth parenthesized subexpression of the regular expression.

   [1mBasic vs Extended Regular Expressions[0m
       In basic regular expressions the meta-characters [1m?[22m, [1m+[22m, [1m{[22m, [1m|[22m, [1m([22m, and [1m) [22mlose their special
       meaning; instead use the backslashed versions [1m\?[22m, [1m\+[22m, [1m\{[22m, [1m\|[22m, [1m\([22m, and [1m\)[22m.

[1mEXIT STATUS[0m
       Normally  the exit status is 0 if a line is selected, 1 if no lines were selected, and 2
       if an error occurred.  However, if the [1m-q [22mor [1m--quiet [22mor [1m--silent [22mis used and a  line  is
       selected, the exit status is 0 even if an error occurred.

[1mENVIRONMENT[0m
       The behavior of [1mgrep [22mis affected by the following environment variables.

       The locale for category [1mLC_[4m[22mfoo[24m is specified by examining the three environment variables
       [1mLC_ALL[22m, [1mLC_[4m[22mfoo[24m, [1mLANG[22m, in that order.  The first of these variables that is set specifies
       the  locale.   For  example, if [1mLC_ALL [22mis not set, but [1mLC_MESSAGES [22mis set to [1mpt_BR[22m, then
       the Brazilian Portuguese locale is used for the [1mLC_MESSAGES [22mcategory.  The C  locale  is
       used  if  none  of  these  environment  variables  are set, if the locale catalog is not
       installed, or if [1mgrep [22mwas not compiled with national language support (NLS).  The  shell
       command [1mlocale -a [22mlists locales that are currently available.

       [1mGREP_COLOR[0m
              This variable specifies the color used to highlight matched (non-empty) text.  It
              is deprecated in favor of [1mGREP_COLORS[22m, but still supported.  The [1mmt[22m, [1mms[22m,  and  [1mmc[0m
              capabilities of [1mGREP_COLORS [22mhave priority over it.  It can only specify the color
              used to highlight the matching non-empty text in any matching  line  (a  selected
              line  when  the  [1m-v  [22mcommand-line option is omitted, or a context line when [1m-v [22mis
              specified).  The default is [1m01;31[22m, which means a bold red foreground text on  the
              terminal's default background.

       [1mGREP_COLORS[0m
              Specifies  the colors and other attributes used to highlight various parts of the
              output.  Its value is a colon-separated list of  capabilities  that  defaults  to
              [1mms=01;31:mc=01;31:sl=:cx=:fn=35:ln=32:bn=32:se=36  [22mwith  the  [1mrv  [22mand  [1mne [22mboolean
              capabilities omitted (i.e., false).  Supported capabilities are as follows.

              [1msl=    [22mSGR substring for whole selected lines (i.e., matching lines when  the  [1m-v[0m
                     command-line   option  is  omitted,  or  non-matching  lines  when  [1m-v  [22mis
                     specified).  If however the boolean [1mrv [22mcapability and the [1m-v  [22mcommand-line
                     option  are  both specified, it applies to context matching lines instead.
                     The default is empty (i.e., the terminal's default color pair).

              [1mcx=    [22mSGR substring for whole context lines (i.e., non-matching lines  when  the
                     [1m-v   [22mcommand-line  option  is  omitted,  or  matching  lines  when  [1m-v  [22mis
                     specified).  If however the boolean [1mrv [22mcapability and the [1m-v  [22mcommand-line
                     option  are  both  specified,  it  applies  to selected non-matching lines
                     instead.  The default is empty (i.e., the terminal's default color pair).

              [1mrv     [22mBoolean value that reverses (swaps)  the  meanings  of  the  [1msl=  [22mand  [1mcx=[0m
                     capabilities when the [1m-v [22mcommand-line option is specified.  The default is
                     false (i.e., the capability is omitted).

              [1mmt=01;31[0m
                     SGR substring for matching non-empty text in any matching  line  (i.e.,  a
                     selected  line  when  the  [1m-v [22mcommand-line option is omitted, or a context
                     line when [1m-v [22mis specified).  Setting this is equivalent  to  setting  both
                     [1mms=  [22mand  [1mmc=  [22mat  once to the same value.  The default is a bold red text
                     foreground over the current line background.

              [1mms=01;31[0m
                     SGR substring for matching non-empty text in a selected  line.   (This  is
                     only  used when the [1m-v [22mcommand-line option is omitted.)  The effect of the
                     [1msl= [22m(or [1mcx= [22mif [1mrv[22m) capability remains active  when  this  kicks  in.   The
                     default is a bold red text foreground over the current line background.

              [1mmc=01;31[0m
                     SGR  substring  for  matching  non-empty text in a context line.  (This is
                     only used when the [1m-v [22mcommand-line option is specified.)   The  effect  of
                     the  [1mcx= [22m(or [1msl= [22mif [1mrv[22m) capability remains active when this kicks in.  The
                     default is a bold red text foreground over the current line background.

              [1mfn=35  [22mSGR substring for file names prefixing any content line.  The default is a

              [1mln=32  [22mSGR substring for line numbers prefixing any content line.  The default is
                     a green text foreground over the terminal's default background.

              [1mbn=32  [22mSGR substring for byte offsets prefixing any content line.  The default is
                     a green text foreground over the terminal's default background.

              [1mse=36  [22mSGR  substring  for  separators  that  are  inserted between selected line
                     fields ([1m:[22m), between context  line  fields,  ([1m-[22m),  and  between  groups  of
                     adjacent  lines  when nonzero context is specified ([1m--[22m).  The default is a
                     cyan text foreground over the terminal's default background.

              [1mne     [22mBoolean value that prevents clearing to the end of  line  using  Erase  in
                     Line  (EL)  to  Right  ([1m\33[K[22m)  each  time a colorized item ends.  This is
                     needed on terminals on which EL is not supported.  It is otherwise  useful
                     on  terminals  for  which  the  [1mback_color_erase  [22m([1mbce[22m)  boolean  terminfo
                     capability does not apply, when the chosen highlight colors do not  affect
                     the  background,  or  when EL is too slow or causes too much flicker.  The
                     default is false (i.e., the capability is omitted).

              Note that boolean capabilities have no [1m=[22m... part.  They are omitted (i.e., false)
              by default and become true when specified.

              See  the  Select Graphic Rendition (SGR) section in the documentation of the text
              terminal that is used  for  permitted  values  and  their  meaning  as  character
              attributes.   These  substring  values are integers in decimal representation and
              can be concatenated with semicolons.  [1mgrep [22mtakes care of  assembling  the  result
              into  a complete SGR sequence ([1m\33[[22m...[1mm[22m).  Common values to concatenate include [1m1[0m

       [1mLC_ALL[22m, [1mLC_COLLATE[22m, [1mLANG[0m
              These  variables specify the locale for the [1mLC_COLLATE [22mcategory, which determines
              the collating sequence used to interpret range expressions like [1m[a-z][22m.

              These variables specify the locale for the [1mLC_CTYPE  [22mcategory,  which  determines
              the  type  of  characters,  e.g., which characters are whitespace.  This category
              also determines the character encoding, that  is,  whether  text  is  encoded  in
              UTF-8,  ASCII,  or some other encoding.  In the C or POSIX locale, all characters
              are encoded as a single byte and every byte is a valid character.

       [1mLC_ALL[22m, [1mLC_MESSAGES[22m, [1mLANG[0m
              These variables specify the locale for the [1mLC_MESSAGES [22mcategory, which determines
              the  language  that  [1mgrep  [22muses for messages.  The default C locale uses American
              English messages.

       [1mPOSIXLY_CORRECT[0m
              If set, [1mgrep [22mbehaves as POSIX requires; otherwise, [1mgrep [22mbehaves more  like  other
              GNU programs.  POSIX requires that options that follow file names must be treated
              as file names; by default, such options are permuted to the front of the  operand
              list  and are treated as options.  Also, POSIX requires that unrecognized options
              be diagnosed as “illegal”, but since they are not  really  against  the  law  the
              default  is  to  diagnose  them  as  “invalid”.   [1mPOSIXLY_CORRECT  [22malso  disables
              [1m_[4m[22mN[24m[1m_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_[22m, described below.

       [1m_[4m[22mN[24m[1m_GNU_nonoption_argv_flags_[0m
              (Here [4mN[24m is [1mgrep[22m's numeric process ID.)  If the [4mi[24mth character of this  environment
              variable's  value  is [1m1[22m, do not consider the [4mi[24mth operand of [1mgrep [22mto be an option,
              even if it appears to be one.  A shell can put this variable in  the  environment
              for  each command it runs, specifying which operands are the results of file name
              wildcard expansion and therefore should not be treated as options.  This behavior
              is  available  only  with the GNU C library, and only when [1mPOSIXLY_CORRECT [22mis not
              set.

   [1mKnown Bugs[0m
       Large repetition counts in the [1m{[4m[22mn[24m[1m,[4m[22mm[24m[1m} [22mconstruct may cause [1mgrep [22mto use lots of memory.  In
       addition,  certain other obscure regular expressions require exponential time and space,
       and may cause [1mgrep [22mto run out of memory.

       Back-references are very slow, and may require exponential time.

[1mEXAMPLE[0m
       The following example outputs the location and contents of any line containing  “f”  and
       ending  in  “.c”,  within all files in the current directory whose names contain “g” and
       end in “.h”.  The [1m-n [22moption outputs line numbers, the [1m-- [22margument treats  expansions  of
       “*g*.h” starting with “-” as file names not options, and the empty file /dev/null causes
       file names to be output even if only one file name happens to be of the form “*g*.h”.

         $ [1mgrep [22m-n -- 'f.*\.c$' *g*.h /dev/null
         argmatch.h:1:/* definitions and prototypes for argmatch.c

       The only line that matches is line 1 of argmatch.h.  Note that  the  regular  expression
       syntax used in the pattern differs from the globbing syntax that the shell uses to match
       file names.
